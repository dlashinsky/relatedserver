1. In index.js:  do we need a callback of "err" in db.on function to track bugs?

2. Do we need to include 'auth-locked' in our routes?
    
    2.1 Does the Client end have to unencryped the JWT every time that 
        an event takes place in the front?  Or once the user is logged in
        the JWT token is decryped and once the user CRUDs into the database
        its already authenticated and therefore no longer needing to decode
        the JWT token.


3.  Issue with .env file:  Do we have to add it back everytime we push/pull to 
    github?
